# AWS Bedrock with Anthropic Claude 3.5 and LangChain - Streamlit Application

## Project Overview

This project integrates **AWS Bedrock** with **Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonet** to build an AI application in Python. It uses **LangChain** to streamline the interaction with the model and **Boto3** to manage communications with AWS services. The front-end is built with **Streamlit** to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the model.

### Key Technologies:

- **AWS Bedrock**: Access and manage Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonet for training and inference.
- **Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonet**: A powerful large language model from Anthropic.
- **LangChain**: Enables multi-step interaction pipelines and task automation with language models.
- **Boto3**: AWS SDK for Python to interface with Bedrock services.
- **Streamlit**: Provides a web-based interface for user interaction with the AI model.

The application facilitates natural language understanding, allowing users to query and interact with the Claude 3.5 model in real time.

## Features

- Access Claude 3.5 model via AWS Bedrock.
- Use LangChain for conversation pipelines.
- Simple and interactive interface with Streamlit.
- Manage model-related operations using Boto3.
